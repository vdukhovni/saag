   <t>
     This memo introduces the "Opportunistic Security" (OS) protocol
     design pattern.  Protocol designs based on OS depart from the
     established practice of employing cryptographic protection
     against both passive and active attacks, or no protection at
     all.  OS protocols tailor the minimum acceptable channel
     security to the capabilities of the peer systems.  As a result,
     at least some cryptographic protection is provided most of the
     time.
   </t>

   <t>
     This document is aimed primarily at protocol designers.  It
     facilitates designs that are more resistant to passive wiretaps,
     and designs in which cryptographic protection against active
     attacks can be rolled out incrementally as suitably capable
     systems are deployed.  Another audience is operators who set
     policy for systems that can implement opportunistic security.

  <section title="Introduction">

   <t>
     Encryption is easy, but key management is difficult.  For
     example, the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) used for the web
     (often called the "Web PKI") is based on broadly trusted public
     certification authorities (CAs).  The Web PKI has too many
     fully trusted authorities and imposes burdens that not all
     peers are willing to bear.  Web PKI public CAs are not always
     sufficient to authenticate the peer system.  Web PKI authentication
     is vulnerable to MiTM attacks when the peer reference identifier
     (<xref target="RFC6125"/>) is obtained indirectly over an
     insecure channel, perhaps via an MX or SRV lookup.  And with
     so many certification authorities the communicating parties
     don't always agree on a mutually trusted CA.
   </t>

   <t>
     At this time, DNS Security (DNSSEC <xref target="RFC4033"/>)
     is not sufficiently widely adopted to make DNS-Based Authentication
     of Named Entities (DANE <xref target="RFC6698"/>) a viable
     ubiquitous alternative to CAs.  Trust on first use (TOFU) key management
     models (such as saved SSH fingerprints and various certificate
     pinning approaches) don't protect initial contact, and require more
     user intervention when keys change unexpectedly.
   </t>

   <t>
     Historically, Internet security protocols have prioritized
     comprehensive cryptographic protection against both passive
     and active attacks.  Protection against active attacks requires
     authentication, but the lack of a universal key management
     approach has created a situation in which only a minority of
     peers can be authenticated.  When protocols only offer the
     options of an authenticated secure channel or cleartext, most
     traffic is sent in the clear.  As a result, while communications
     traffic is sometimes strongly protected, more typically it is
     not protected at all.  The fact that most traffic is unencrypted
     makes pervasive monitoring easier by making it cost-effective,
     or at least not cost-prohibitive; see <xref target="RFC7258"/>
     for more detail.
   </t>

   <t>
     If security protocols were designed to encrypt traffic whenever
     possible, bulk collection of communications traffic would be
     substantially less attractive.  Even if one is not concerned
     about pervasive monitoring, passive wiretaps by individual
     malicious actors or criminal organizations are still a potential
     problem for individuals and organizations.  Using the opportunistic
     security design makes passive attacks more difficult for all
     these actors.
   </t>

   <t>
     In order to make encryption more ubiquitous, authentication
     should not be required where it cannot be expected.  Against
     the background of pervasive monitoring and other passive
     attacks, when authenticated communication is not possible,
     unauthenticated encryption is preferable to cleartext.  The
     opportunistic security design pattern promotes stepping up
     from cleartext, not down from authenticated encryption.
     Opportunistic security encourages peers to employ as much
     security as possible, without falling back on unnecessarily
     weak options.  In particular, opportunistic security encourages
     unauthenticated encryption rather than cleartext when
     authentication is not an option.
   </t>

   <t>
     The risk of active attacks should also not be ignored.  The
     opportunistic security design pattern features a range of
     cryptographic protection levels, with encrypted transmission
     accessible to most if not all peers.  Even with opportunistic
     security, protection against active attacks is still employed
     where unconditionally required by policy or else determined
     to be applicable with a given peer.

  <section title="The Opportunistic Security Design Pattern">

   <t>
     Opportunistic Security is a protocol design pattern that aims
     to remove barriers to the widespread use of encryption on the
     Internet.  The opportunistic security design pattern involves
     determining the security mechanisms to use, whether to enforce
     their use, and how to handle errors with, or non-use of those
     security mechanisms, based on advertised (in-band out-of-band)
     capabilities of the specific communicating peers.  When the
     peer capability advertisement matches reality, opportunistic
     security is expected to not get in the way of communicating
     with that peer.  Security services that "just work" are more
     likely to be deployed and enabled by default.
   </t>

   <t>
     The determination of which security mechanisms to use can vary
     from case to case when the OS design pattern is used with
     different protocols.  The cryptographic protection level one
     gets from the OS pattern will depend on the protocol making
     use of the pattern. In many cases, OS will result in negotiating
     channels with one of the following security properties:
   </t>

   <t>
     <list style="symbols">

      <t> No encryption (cleartext), which protects against neither
      passive nor active attacks.  </t>

      <t> Unauthenticated encryption, which protects only against
      passive attacks.  </t>

      <t> Authenticated encryption, which protects against both
      passive and active attacks.  </t>

     </list>
   </t>

   <t>
     Note that the opportunistic security design pattern is not
     limited to unauthenticated encryption.  Opportunistic security
     protocols should, provide a means to enforce authentication
     for those peers for which authentication is required by policy
     or can be expected to succeed based on information provided
     by the peer.  Enforcement of authentication in an opportunistic
     protocol is not a contradiction.
   </t>

   <t>
     Opportunistic security does not start with an overly optimistic
     view of peer capabilities only to be "disappointed" and settle
     for less when the peer fails to live up to expectations.
     Rather, the opportunistic security design pattern starts with
     a pessimistic view of the baseline capabilities of all peers,
     and is "pleasantly surprised" to learn that some peers can be
     expected to do more.  Opportunistic security aims to do better
     than might be expected, rather than worse than might be hoped.
   </t>

   <t>
     For example, some peers may commit to support authentication
     via DANE, TOFU or other means.  With DANE, the discovery via
     DNSSEC-validated TLSA records that a peer is committed to
     support authentication is downgrade-resistant.  Since DNSSEC
     provides authenticated denial of existence, an MiTM attacker
     needs to compromise DNSSEC in order to suppress a peer's TLSA
     records.
   </t>

   <t>
     Unless preempted by local or other policy, an opportunistic
     security protocol first determines for a given peer whether
     that peer supports authenticated encryption, unauthenticated
     encryption or perhaps only cleartext.  The appropriate
     communications security policy is then employed for each peer.
   </t>

   <t>
     In the opportunistic security design pattern, authentication
     failure MAY be a reason to abort a connection to a peer that
     is expected to be authenticated.  However, such a failure MUST
     NOT then lead to communication in cleartext when encryption
     is an option.  Some Message Transfer Agents (MTAs, <xref
     target="RFC5598"/> Section 4.3.2) employing STARTTLS (<xref
     target="RFC3207"/>) have been observed to abort TLS (<xref
     target="RFC5246"/>) transmission when the receiving MTA fails
     authentication, only to immediately deliver the same message
     over a cleartext connection.  The OS design pattern avoids
     this obvious problem.
   </t>

   <t>
     More fine-grained security policy, such as the selection of a
     particular encryption algorithm or key agreement scheme, is
     left to the underlying cryptographic protocols such as TLS.
     The underlying cryptographic protocols themselves cannot be
     said to implement opportunistic security or to lack it; they
     typically allow implementation and operational policies that
     are based on the OS design pattern.  An OS protocol may demand
     more stringent security from the underlying cryptographic
     protocols when authenticated encryption is required than when
     only unauthenticated encryption is employed.
   </t>

   <t>
     Cleartext support is for backwards compatibility with already
     deployed systems.  Cleartext transmission should, be avoided
     in new OS protocol designs.  Even when cleartext needs to be
     supported, protocol designs based on opportunistic security
     MUST at least prefer to encrypt network traffic, while allowing
     fallback to cleartext with peers that do not appear to be
     encryption capable.
   </t>

  </section>

  <section title="Opportunistic Security Design Principles">

   <t>
    <list style="hanging">

     <t hangText="Coexist with explicit policy:">Explicit security
     policy preempts opportunistic behavior.  Administrators or
     users may elect to disable opportunistic security for some or
     all peers and set a fixed security policy not based on
     capabilities advertised or published by the peer.  Alternatively,
     opportunistic security might be enabled only for specified peers,
     rather than by default.  Opportunistic security is not intended
     to displace or preempt local policy.  However, it is likely that
     where static policy is in conflict with reality, opportunistic
     security will lead to better outcomes.  </t>

     <t hangText="Prioritize not getting in the way:">
     The primary goal of designs that feature opportunistic security
     is to enable communication and maximize deployment.  If a
     non-negligible number of potential peers are only capable of
     cleartext, then it is acceptable to fall back to cleartext
     when encryption is not possible.  If authentication is only
     possible for some peers, then it is acceptable to authenticate
     only those peers and not the rest.  Communication must be
     possible without prior coordination of security policy by the
     administrators of the peer systems.  Opportunistic security
     needs to be deployable with each peer independently configured
     to meet its security needs (within the practical bounds of the
     employed protocol).  Opportunistic security must not get in
     the way of the peers communicating if neither end is misconfigured
     (i.e., neither publishes or negotiates security services that
     are not available or don't function correctly).  </t>

     <t hangText="Maximize security peer by peer:"> Opportunistic
     security strives to maximize security based on the capabilities
     of the peers.  For some opportunistic security protocols, the
     maximal cryptographic protection possible may be just
     unauthenticated encryption to address passive wiretaps.  For
     other protocols, protection against active attacks may be an
     option.  Opportunistic security protocols may, when applicable,
     refuse to communicate with peers for which higher security is
     expected, but for some reason not achieved.  The conditions
     under which connections fail should generally be limited to
     operational errors at one or the other peer or an active attack,
     so that well-maintained systems rarely encounter problems in
     normal use of opportunistic security.  </t>

     <t hangText="Encrypt by default:"> An opportunistic security
     protocol MUST be capable of achieving at least unauthenticated
     encryption between peer systems that don't explicitly disable
     this capability.  To facilitate incremental deployment,
     opportunistic security protocols may tolerate cleartext
     connections or sessions with peers that don't support encryption.
     Over time, as peer software is updated to support opportunistic
     security, only legacy systems or a minority of systems where
     encryption is disabled should be communicating in cleartext.
     Whenever possible, opportunistic security should employ Perfect
     Forward Secrecy (PFS) to make recovery of previously sent keys
     and plaintext computationally expensive even after disclosure
     of long-term keys.  </t>

     <t hangText="No misrepresentation of security:"> Unauthenticated
     encrypted communication MUST NOT be misrepresented as communication
     over a secure channel.  </t>

    </list>
   </t>

   <t>
     In summary, the opportunistic security design pattern encompasses
     protocol designs that remove barriers to the widespread use
     of encryption on the Internet.  The actual protection provided
     by opportunistic security depends on the advertised (in-band
     or out-of-band) capabilities of the communicating peers.
     Opportunistic security MUST at least aim to encrypt network
     traffic, while allowing fallback to cleartext with peers that
     do not appear to be encryption capable.

  <section title="Example: Opportunistic TLS in SMTP">

   <t>
     Many MTAs support the STARTTLS (<xref target="RFC3207"/>)
     ESMTP extension, however STARTTLS support is not yet universal.
     In the absence of local policy to the contrary, MTAs acting
     as SMTP clients are generally willing to send email in
     cleartext, but will employ TLS when the SMTP server's EHLO
     response advertises STARTTLS support.  Since the EHLO response
     is not cryptographically protected, this advertisement is
     vulnerable to MiTM downgrade attacks.  Thus opportunistic
     TLS based on STARTTLS support can only protect against passive
     attacks, and MTAs do not generally require peer authentication.
     Self-signed certificates are common on receiving MTAs, and
     the server name is generally obtained via insecure MX lookups.
   </t>

   <t>
     Therefore, MTAs that implement opportunistic TLS employ at
     most unauthenticated encryption, or else deliver over a
     cleartext channel.  However, recent reports from a number
     of large providers suggest that the majority of SMTP email
     transmission on the Internet is now encrypted.  And the trend
     is toward increasing adoption.
   </t>

   <t>
     Not only is the STARTTLS advertisement is vulnerable to active
     attacks, but also at present some MTAs that advertise STARTTLS
     exhibit various interoperability problems in their implementations.
     As a result, it is common practice to fall back to cleartext
     transmission not only when STARTTLS is not offered, but also
     when the TLS handshake fails, or even when TLS fails during
     message transmission.
   </t>

   <t>
     Protection against active attacks for SMTP is proposed in
     <xref target="I-D.ietf-dane-smtp-with-dane"/>.
   </t>

  </section>

  <section title="Security Considerations" anchor="sec_security">

    <t>
      Though opportunistic security potentially supports transmission
      in cleartext, unauthenticated encryption, or other cryptographic
      protection levels short of the strongest potentially applicable,
      the effective security for peers is always increased and never
      reduced.  If a cryptographic capability is neither required
      by policy nor supported by the peer, nothing is lost by going
      without.  Opportunistic security is strictly stronger than
      the alternative of providing no security services when maximal
      security is not applicable.
    </t>

    <t>
      Opportunistic security does not require reducing security
      policy to the lowest common denominator.  Opportunistic
      security coexists with and is preempted by any a-priori security
      policy that is not based on advertised peer capabilities.
      However, such a-priori policy can be counter-productive when
      it expects more than most peers can in fact deliver.  A-priori
      policy should be used with care, lest users find it too
      restrictive and act to disable security entirely.  Opportunistic
      security aims to enable incremental rollout of cryptographic
      protection against both passive and active attacks as appropriate
      software and configurations are deployed one system at a time.
